1. Learning to train a neural network for predicting targets with good accuracy using deep learning. 

2. First you preprocess that data, then you split the data into train validation and test. 
   Train the model with training and validation samples.

3. Define the model, compile it and then fit it to the training & validation data. 
   Choose the appropriate loss function and optimizer. 
   If the validation accuracy is unstable, increasing and decreasing, i.e fluctuating between near values, you are probably over fitting the data. 
   To stop over fitting, put an early stopper, and set a patience level to it. 

4. Evaluate your model with the test data. 

Your model is ready! :)
